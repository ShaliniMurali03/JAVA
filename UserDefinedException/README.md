"Custom Exception" | Error Handling! 

1️⃣  "Custom Exception" is a user-defined exception class tailored to specific error scenarios.

2️⃣  By extending the Exception class, Custom Exception becomes a checked exception, requiring explicit handling or declaration. This helps prevent runtime errors and improves the overall stability of the application.

3️⃣  The constructor of this custom exception takes a message parameter, allowing developers to provide a meaningful error message that conveys the context and cause of the exception when it is thrown and caught in other parts of the code.

This enhances code readability, promotes better error handling practices, and adheres to established Java conventions.

However, it's essential to use checked exceptions judiciously. Overuse of checked exceptions can lead to code clutter and boilerplate exception handling in methods where immediate error recovery might not be necessary. In such cases, unchecked exceptions (extending "RuntimeException" or its subclasses) might be more appropriate.
